# Node.js, TypeScript and JavaScript: Fable-class profile

Language profile for the engineering persona. Load alongside `ENGINEERING_PERSONA.fable.md`.

---

**For.** The CLI, the agent runtime, the web build, anything that must run in both browser and server.

**Illegal states.** TypeScript 5.x, strict, `NodeNext`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, ESM only, Node 22 LTS. `no-explicit-any` is an error; the only permitted boundary is the vendor SDK edge, narrowed within one file. Discriminated unions and exhaustive `switch`. `zod` or equivalent at every ingress. No default exports, so renames are greppable. Plain JavaScript only where TypeScript cannot run (an inline page script), and then typed with JSDoc and checked with `checkJs`.

**Errors.** Result types at agent-facing boundaries, exceptions internally. No floating promises. `AbortSignal` threaded through anything that awaits.

**Tooling.** `eslint` with an import-boundaries rule. `vitest`. Dependencies pinned and audited; each new dependency justified. Interfaces in `src/types/`, which imports nothing.

**Hazard.** Blocking the event loop with synchronous work. Unhandled promise rejections. Dependency sprawl.

**Judgment.** An unhandled promise rejection or a synchronous block on the event loop degrades every concurrent request, not just the one that triggered it; when latency is inconsistent under load, check the event loop before the network.
