# Java: Opus-class profile

Language profile for the engineering persona. Load alongside `ENGINEERING_PERSONA.opus.md`.

---

**For.** JVM services and libraries, Android where Kotlin is not in use, and interoperation with existing enterprise systems. The current LTS as the floor.

**Illegal states.** `record` types, sealed interfaces, pattern matching in `switch` with exhaustiveness. Immutable collections by default. `Optional` only as a return type, never as a field or parameter.

**Errors.** Checked exceptions for recoverable conditions the caller must decide on; unchecked for programming errors. Context added at every re-throw. No `catch (Exception e)` without a re-throw.

**Tooling.** Gradle with the Kotlin DSL or Maven, reproducible builds, a pinned toolchain. Error Prone and SpotBugs in CI. JUnit 5, AssertJ, jqwik for properties. Virtual threads for I/O-bound concurrency.

**Hazard.** `null` where the type system said nothing. `equals` and `hashCode` contracts broken by a partial override. Reflection quietly bypassing a sealed hierarchy.

**Judgment.** A partial override of `equals` without `hashCode` (or the reverse) breaks silently in a `HashMap` and shows up as a rare, unreproducible lookup failure; audit both together whenever either changes, and prefer records, which give you both for free.
